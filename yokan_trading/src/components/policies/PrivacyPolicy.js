        <p>
          We completely understand that Customer Data is very confidential and
          sensitive to the customers of Yokan trading, and for this reason we
          have made every effort to ensure that you are comfortable in giving
          Yokan trading the data needed to use the Service. Customer Data is
          stored on secure servers, and all transactions with Yokan trading are
          conducted using Secure Socket Layers (SSL).
        </p>
        <p>
          Yokan trading requires a phone number and password to log in. You must
          keep your username and password secure, and never disclose it to a
          third party. You should also sign out of your Yokan trading account
          and terminate your browser window whenever you are done with using
          Yokan trading so that others cannot access your Customer Data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the Customer Data is so sensitive, account passwords are
          encrypted, which means that we cannot see your passwords. We also
          cannot resend forgotten passwords. We can only delete your previous
          user data and create a new one. The security of Customer Data is very
          important to us, but please remember that no method of transmission
          over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we strive to use all commercially acceptable means to protect
          Customer Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If a
          security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our system that
          materially affects you or your Customer Data, then Yokan trading will
          notify you as soon as possible and later report the action we took in
          response.
